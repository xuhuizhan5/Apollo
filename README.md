# Apollo Audio Generation and Recording Demo
## Author: Xuhui Zhan, Siyu Yang

This project repository contains scripts for generating and recording audio using advanced machine learning models, including transformer-based models for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. 

## 1. Background Information

### 1.1 Text-to-Speech (TTS)

Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology converts written text into spoken voice output. TTS systems are often used in applications like virtual assistants, navigation systems, and accessibility tools for visually impaired users. The TTS process involves two main steps: text analysis, where the text is converted into a linguistic structure, and sound generation, where this structure is used to synthesize the spoken output. Modern TTS systems often use deep learning and transformer models, which allow for more natural and expressive voice synthesis compared to traditional methods.

### 1.2 Transformers in Audio Processing
Transformers are a type of deep learning model that have revolutionized many areas of machine learning, particularly natural language processing (NLP). Their ability to handle sequences of data and their scalability have also made them increasingly popular in audio processing tasks. In this repository, we utilize transformer models for generating speech from text. These models are capable of capturing the nuances of human speech, such as intonation and rhythm, more effectively than prior techniques.
